# Replies to referee comments

We have completed the revision of our submission *4632*. We note that both
authors answered *Yes* to the question about the ability of our article to
have an impact on the subject of area. Other than that, the two referees
raised several valid issues, which we thoroughly addressed. We would like to
thank them for helping strengthening our point.

## Reviewer 1 (Jones)

As ref. 1 points out, most of our paper discusses recent advances in our
behaviour regarding data sharing. This is done *on purpose*. On one hand,
previous forum papers on the subject have already been reviewed
and synthesized, and as such there is no interest in reproducing
the exercise. On the other hand, it's hard to argue against the
fact that the playing field of data-sharing has changed *a lot* in
the recent years. The last two years alone saw the apparition of
*figshare*, changes in policy of several journals and societies
(notably the BES) regarding open data, and more broadly, the rise of
an ecosystem of open-source projects leveraging these open datasets.

These aspects now need to be addressed, and this is the objective of our
paper: to ensure that the discussion around open-data accounts for these
practical and technological developments. **We reinforced this aspect on the
revision of our paper**.

Ref. 1 argues against JSON as a robust format for data interchange. This is
a surprising position, for several reasons. JSON, over several other formats
proposed by the referee, can be validated against schemes (in addition to the
fact that, contrary to CSV, it has a formal specification). This ensures
that the data are syntactically correct. In addition, the scheme describes the
data format and typing, and as such serves as its own data-specification.
Although a JSON object is, as the ref. says, not self-descriptive, the
combination of JSON and a scheme, with the possibility of automatic validation,
is. Regardless of the quality check allowed by JSON + schemes, this
format emerged as a *de facto* standard for API, which already are
the favoured way to interact with large, open datasets. Because the referee's comment was perhaps consequent to an incomplete argumentation about JSON in the previous version, **we
reinforced the case for JSON in the paper**.

The referee's point about *archiving* vs. *sharing* reflects its own opinion. As
this is an opinion paper, we accept the risk of not reaching consensus with some readers. **We kept the incriminated part, but reinforced our
point**.
