abstract = {Bioinformatics, the application of computational tools to the management and analysis of biological data, has stimulated rapid research advances in genomics through the development of data archives such as GenBank, and similar progress is just beginning within ecology. One reason for the belated adoption of informatics approaches in ecology is the breadth of ecologically pertinent data (from genes to the biosphere) and its highly heterogeneous nature. The variety of formats, logical structures, and sampling methods in ecology create significant challenges. Cultural barriers further impede progress, especially for the creation and adoption of data standards. Here we describe informatics frameworks for ecology, from subject-specific data warehouses, to generic data collections that use detailed metadata descriptions and formal ontologies to catalog and cross-reference information. Combining these approaches with automated data integration techniques and scientific workflow systems will maximize the value of data and open new frontiers for research in ecology.},

@article{Carraway2011,
abstract = {New knowledge in science is built on previous knowledge. Thus, the primary purpose of preserving scientific knowledge is that future scientists will be able collate said knowledge years from now to answer questions not yet asked. Secondarily, if preserved, datasets associated with published research papers could be compared to or combined with datasets collected by future scientists. This will lessen the need to repeat research and will allow examination of what and how environments, and communities and populations of living organisms have changed over time. My concerns regarding the preservation of scientific knowledge—particularly published papers—for use by future researchers are not just that such knowledge continues to exist for a few generations of scientists, but that it survives in perpetuity in accessible formats. Loss of publications containing interpretations based on data and previous knowledge is as critical if not more so than just the loss of data to the continuity of scientific knowledge. Nevertheless, knowledge and datasets are not synonymous; however, they are integrally linked because it takes some of one to produce the other. Reconstructing an event or establishing the history of some unit of knowledge can be extraordinarily labor- and time-intensive in the print world, but it is possible. In the digital world, we can use search engines to hasten the process; however, this just lulls us into a false sense of security. Whereas properly archived acid-free paper has the potential of lasting forever, digital media lacks that potential. Material “stored” on an Internet website may seem permanent, but that permanence is merely an illusion. Knowledge on the Internet is only as secure as there are people, scientific societies, corporations or government agencies willing to maintain websites and pay for the cost of the website presence. Scientists must demand of scientific societies and publishers of their journals that not only should published papers be archived in perpetuity, but that datasets used to produce those manuscripts also be archived in perpetuity in such a manner that other scientists can understand what data are present. The perpetual, not just short-term, future of scientists' ability to access, collate and rethink the determined knowledge of past scientists is dependent on the actions of members of scientific societies to convince the general public, universities, corporations and government agencies that it is essential to guard against the loss of knowledge that otherwise will have to be rediscovered.},

abstract = {Many ecology and evolution journals have recently adopted policies requiring that data from their papers be publicly archived. I present suggestions on how data generators, data re-users, and journals can maximize the fairness and scientific value of data archiving. Data should be archived with enough clarity and supporting information that they can be accurately interpreted by others. Re-users should respect their intellectual debt to the originators of data through citation both of the paper and of the data package. In addition, journals should consider requiring that all data for published papers be archived, just as DNA sequences must be deposited in GenBank. Data are another valuable part of the legacy of a scientific career and archiving them can lead to new scientific insights. Archiving also increases opportunities for credit to be given to the scientists who originally collected the data.},

abstract = {The replication of important findings by multiple independent investigators is fundamental to the accumulation of scientific evidence. Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},
