# Introduction

Claude Bernard [@Bernard1864] wrote that "art is *me*; science is *us*". This
sentence has two meanings. First, the altruism of scientists is worth more to
Bernard than the self-indulgence of mid-nineteenth century Parisian art scene.
Second, and we will keep this one in mind, creativity and insights come from
individuals, but validation and rigor are reached through collective efforts,
cross-validation, and peerage. Given enough time, the conclusions reached and
validated by the efforts of many will take prominence over individualities,
and this (as far as Bernard is concerned), is what science is about. With the
technology available to a modern scientist, one should expect that the
dissolution of *me* would be accelerated, and that several scientists should
be able to cast a critical eye on data, and use this collective effort to draw
robust conclusions.

In molecular evolution, there exists a large number of databases (*GenBank*,
*EMBL*, *SwissProt*, and many more) in which information can be
retrieved. Such initiatives value (and promote) a new type of scientific
research: building-on and extending the raw material of others, it is now
possible to identify new phenomenon or evaluate the generality of previously
studied ones. The job of scientists relying on these databases is not to *make*
data, nor to *steal* them, it is rather to gather them and, most of all,
look at them in a different way. This would not be possible, if not for the
existence of public, free, online repositories. Depositing data in public
repositories is so deeply ingrained in the culture of these disciplines that
the "debate" on data sharing is non-existent. It is sadly impossible to be
as enthusiastic when looking at current practices in ecology. Although there
are many repositories available, their usage is entirely compulsory (*i.e.*
let to the good will of authors), and there is often no way to have
programmatic interactions with the data. This, in our opinion, goes a long
way in explaining why there is no widespread data sharing culture among
ecologists. Yet in the recent years, there has been a strong signal that
some organizations are ready to invest time and money in data sharing. For
example, *DataONE* [@Reichman2011] is a large scale initiative, seeking to
curate and make available observational data. We foresee that improving data
sharing practices will be an important endeavor in the coming years, and the
increasing awareness of the scientific community to these practices is
a timely topic.

In this paper, using examples primarily taken from ecology and evolutionary
biology, we will argue that improving our data sharing practices will improve
both the quality of the science, and the reputation of the scientists. Although
the exchange of data between groups is a widespread practice, we must be aware
that it creates an intrinsic inequalities: those with good contacts have access
to datasets, while other are left out. It would make sense that we collectively
decide to abandon this practice, in favor of depositing data in open, free to
access repositories. The recent emergence of several data-sharing platform
(*DataDryad*, *figshare*), and the increase of mainstream attention they now
receive, are the beginning of a disruption in the way we exchange and re-use
data, that ecologists would benefit from. We illustrate how simple steps can be
taken to greatly improve the current state of data sharing, and how we can
encourage its practice of at different levels [@Whitlock2010], and data
citation, to encourage and reward sharing. Our most important point is that
through sharing more data, we will increase both the quality and visibility of
the science we produce. The contribution of synthesis centers, like NCEAS or
NimBIOS, or NESCent, speaks volume in support of this point, so one can only
wonder how this impact would be increased if all the data collected had been
made publicly available. We conclude this paper by showing that most of the
technical aspects of data sharing can easily be mastered, meaning that data are
ready to be liberated!

# Why we ethically must

We strongly believe that data sharing is an ethical obligation for
researchers. In this part, we point out the ethical aspects of data sharing,
both with regards to other scientists, funding agencies,  collaborators, and
the civil society.

## Data acquisition is (mostly) publicly funded

In contrast with other fields such as energy, or pharmaceutical research, most
ecological and evolutionary research is funded through public grants or
charitably-funded programs. Or in other words, most research is dependent on
taxpayers. A recent HSBC report estimated that 80% of research publications
across the world are funded by the public sector [@Graham2013]. In some
fields, most notably conservation biology, it is not uncommon for volunteers
to participate in data gathering. For example, the French temporal survey of
common birds [@Jiguet2006], which resulted in 29 publications in peer-reviewed
journals, is fed entirely through the work of amateur ornithologists. Given
the direct (participatory) or indirect (financial, through public taxes)
involvement of the public in ecological data collection, it is not surprising
that some funding agencies have implemented data availability policies.

For example, *BBSRC* (UK) state that "[p]ublicly-funded research data are
a public good, produced in the public interest", which "should be openly
available to the maximum extent possible". They further add that "[t]he value
of data often depends on timeliness[;] it is expected that timely release would
generally be no later than the release through publication of the main
findings". Similarly, *NERC* (UK) state that "[a]ll the environmental data held
by the NERC Environmental Data Centres will normally be made openly available
to any person or any organization who requests them.". Sanctions for not
sharing data are also put in place, as "[t]hose funded by NERC who do not meet
these requirements risk having award payments withheld or becoming ineligible
for future funding from NERC". This perfectly mirrors one of the earliest
drivers of the open access movement: science publications which are made
possible through public investment must be made public. Publicly funded
scientists, in most countries, are thus civil servants. Generating data is part
of their job description, and there is no rational argument for which they
should claim *property* of it (in addition to the fact that under most
jurisdictions, data are not properties and cannot be copyrighted, a point
we expand upon in the section on licensing issues). Claiming *paternity*
of the data, as we discuss below, is a more legitimate claim than property is,
but nonetheless does not prevent sharing them.

## It improves reproducibility

Using journals to publish scientific information should not only serve the
purpose of disseminating data analysis; it should maximize the ability of other
researchers to replicate, and thus both validate and expand, results. It is
arguably a perversion of the *publish-or-perish* mentality, that we think only
in terms of papers. Interestingly, although editors and referees are very
careful about the way the *Materials & Methods* sections of a paper are worded,
it is extremely rare to receive any comment by referees about the data
availability. However, some journals, including those from the Nature
Publishing Group [@NPG2013] are now implementing policies to evaluate
the quality of the data availability plan. Barring the availability of
data, there is no certainty that the results can be reproduced.

This can cause problems at all steps of the life of a paper. How can a paper
describing a new method be adequately reviewed if data are not available? How
can you be sure that you are correctly applying a method if you can't reproduce
the results? Can increased pressure to release the full dataset will help
identify the (admittedly rare) cases of data falsification? The movement of
*reproducible research* [see *e.g.* @Mesirov2010 for a recent perspective]
advocates that a paper should be self-contained, *i.e.* be not only the text,
but also the data, and the computer code to reproduce the figures.
Even without going to such lengths, releasing data and computer code
alongside a paper should be viewed as an ethical decision. Barnes
[@Barnes2010] made the point that even though researchers are not
professional programmers, computer code is good enough to be shared.

## It will clarify authorship

It is well accepted that the final version of a scientific article reflects the
diversity of backgrounds and scientific sensibilities of its authors
[@McGee2011]. Yet authorship, in the sense of deciding who gets to be listed
as an author, and in which order, is still a key issue in several
collaborations. Additionally, authorship deserves to be properly quantified
[@Tscharntke2007], to reflect the amount of work done by each contributor. Too
strict rules of authorship will not award proper recognition, and rules too
open will grant undue credit. To some extent, journals attempted to qualify
the work of each contributor by having special sections, indicating who wrote
the paper, conceived the study, or contributed data or reagents. This is far
from being anecdotal, as it allows for increased accountability
[@Weltzin2006]. By making dataset public and citeable, the contribution of data
will become less and less of a criteria for authorship. Because the datasets
can be cited independently from their original paper, they will also
contribute to the overall scientific impact of the researcher who generated
them, thus allowing to name as authors only those who analyzed the data.

## Data cost money

Gathering data, either in the lab or in the field, costs money, as it requires
the acquisition and maintenance of equipments and reagents, in addition to
salaries. In this perspective, generating new data when existing ones are
available and could bring answers to a question is a wasteful practice. So as to
avoid this, we need to have an easy way to find suitable data, which require
thorough indexing. The large amount of hard to access data was dubbed 'dark
data' [@Heidorn2008]. The fraction of data falling within this category is
likely to increase. [@Wicherts2006] surveyed the field of psychology, and showed
that asking for the raw data often does not result in a successful data sharing
outcome, even after 6 months of repeated inquiries. Authors can claim to have
'lost' the data, can be extremely slow to reply, can ignore emails, the given
contact email address may be invalid and it can be difficult to find the
'current' contact address. Authors also die or retire, and sadly this can result
in the loss of valuable scientific data unless it has been accessibly and
discoverably archived elsewhere. Ultimately, authors can also flat out refuse to
give the data. The practice of releasing data into the public domain with a CC0
waiver (best) or with minimally-restrictive licenses (some of which are
explained in a later section), and associated with standards-compliant metadata,
will help fight this effect. Overall, by making data easier to access,
understand, and re-use, we will decrease the flow of funding going into data
gathering, and thus decrease the financial pressure on labs.

Assuming that the increase of data sharing will result in enhanced recognition of
the work involved in data collection and curation (which we detail later),
data sharing can also be a way of valorizing "negative" results. Because the
likelihood of a paper being published depends on the significance of the
results it reports, the publication bias in favor of positive results is well
documented across all scientific fields, and results in the accumulation of
statistical bias over time [@Scargle2000]. By dissociating the data from the
paper, and recognizing data as a form of scientific production, it is possible
to encourage the publication of "negative" results. This will allow (i) to
produce research output even though the analysis is not conclusive (thus
providing at least some return on investment), and (ii) to improve the
planning of future experiments, because pre-existing data reporting both
positive and negative outcomes will be available, thus allowing to make more
informed decisions.

# Which benefits it will bring us

In this section, we outline the ways in which sharing research data will
benefit those who produced them, either because it will increase awareness
about their research, or because it will allow others to measure their
scientific production.

## A proxy to your science

Datasets are an alternative means by which people can discover the research
that you do. There is evidence showing that data availability improves
reproducibility and adequate communication of results [@Ince2012]. Similarly,
in some fields, releasing computer code under open source licenses
[@Vandewalle2012] or sharing research data [@Piwowar2007] is associated with
increased citation rates for your papers. Yet one of the argument often
opposed by people reluctant to share their data is that they might risk
loosing paternity of them. The previously cited analyses show that by *not*
sharing data, we are exposed to a higher risk of our research being ignored,
simply because other people cannot re-use or re-examine the data. By
developing a culture of data sharing, and adequate citation of the datasets
re-used, the origin of the data (and thus their paternity) will be made clear.
It seems that by reserving intellectual *property* rights over data (although data cannot be considered as proprty), there are
real risks of data not getting the usage it deserves, reducing scientists
potential impact.

## It stimulates collaboration and creativity

In our experience, releasing computer code (either scripts or full-featured
packages) alongside a paper is a good way to get people to reproduce your
work, and to use your results to build on (if only because it lowers the
technical barrier to reproduce the approach). Some of these interactions
result in collaborations, or in exchanges casting a new light on your previous
work. In the same vein, releasing your data will allow people to explore new
questions using them, which can potentially (i) lead them to interact with you
so as to better exploit them, and (ii) show how your data can still provide
valuable insights after you are done publishing them. The flow of data across
research group is a promising way to increase the diversity of collaborations,
which is viewed favorably by grant agencies [@Lortie2012], and to
a lesser extent, associated with higher citation rates [@Leimu2005].

## It is a significant measure of your research impact

The NSF (US) Grant Proposal Guidelines for 2013 stopped referring to
'Publications' and instead refer to  'Products' [@Piwowar2013]. This change
was specifically performed to make it clear to scientists that research
funders now see great value in research products, not *just* publications.
Research products "include, but are not limited to, publications, data sets,
software, and patents". Thus published, shared datasets are now 'first class
research objects' as they should be (`http://www.force11.org/white_paper`). We
think this is a healthy move that will soon be copied by many research funders
across the world. Modern science needs more than just publications, it needs
shared data to function efficiently. By formally recognizing and encouraging
applicants to put shared datasets on their CV's and show the re-use of these
datasets, the NSF is recognizing the immense and largely untapped value of
data re-use. Just like publications, some datasets will be more re-used and
cited than others. Thus research evaluation exercises will soon be looking to
measure the impact of one's data and software, not just publications.

# How we technically can

In addition to the ethical and pragmatic arguments made above, we engage here
in a more technical reflexion about how we should include data sharing early
in the communication of scientific studies, so as to generate data in a format
allowing their re-usability. We also briefly discuss the different licensing
options.

## Data representation

Except when they are deposited into large-scale databases, data usually live
(in various states of dormancy) on the hard drives of researchers. These data
are usually formatted in the way where they were used to produce the few
figures or run statistical analyses used in the published account, which is to
say mostly as a spreadsheet, or a raw text file [@Akmon2011]. Probably one of
the most commonly used, the CSV (Comma separated values) format, is introducing
significant risks for errors, notably because it lacks a formal specification
(the chief problem being that the field delimiter will vary with the computer
locale, and can interfere badly with the decimal separator or text
characters). Yet, more robust and sharing-friendly formats exist, which should
be taken advantage of as they offer an unprecedented way to organize
information in a way maximizing accessibility. For example, the *JavaScript
Object Notation* (JSON) [@Crockford2006] allows a context-rich representation
of data, which can be based on templates (thus ensuring that several groups
will present their data in the same way). Building upon this format,
a working group can put together a syntax to represent a given type of
ecological data, then provide JSON templates for other people to release
these data. JSON templates (i) serve as a data-specification, and (ii) can
validate the data, thus ensuring that no errors have been made. In addition,
JSON is the *de facto* standard format in most APIs (Application Programming
Interface, essentially a common, well-documented way to interact with,
and re-use, a particular application or data-base). In the ecological
sciences, there are now publications outlets focused only on methodological
papers (e.g. *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*, and to some extent *BMC
Bioinformatics*), and several other journals have sections for
methodological papers. JSON parsers exist for almost all languages (notably
C, Python, R, Java), which means that different applications will be
able to access the shared information. Under this perspective, it is
possible to build local databases. As long as they respect the
specification, groups only need to share the access to these databases.
A "global" access can still be achieved by wrapping all of the local data
sources, through an API, as detailed in the following section.

## Database linkage

An important obstacle is that maintaining a global database requires funding on
a scale which is orders of magnitude higher (in terms of amount and duration)
than what most grants will cover. The solution, building on an increased use
of strict data specification, is to link several local databases (*e.g.*
each research group can keep and take care of its own local database)
through APIs (Fig. 1). In short, an API is an interface to application
stored on a server, which will offer several *methods*, each returning
a *reply*. For example, a *method* can be "retrieve all datasets containing
species A", and the *reply* will be a list of datasets identifiers. If
a particular data format is applied to more than one database, it becomes
possible to query them at once. Under this perspective, the origin of the
data does not matter, because the API will return them in a standardized
fashion. When coupled with a data specification, this allows for seamless
integration of different data sources. Each group implementing such
a database can, in this situation, share the information related to data
access. Instead of putting the raw data on a data sharing platform (some of
which are reviewed below), the authors will give informations about
the study, and informations about where the data are stored, and how to
access them. Ideally, a good data exchange service will be agnostic to the
location of the data. As soon as a specification is fixed, and used
consistently, users can query both sharing platforms and home-grown
database, as long as they know where the resource is located.

## Legal issues - waivers, licenses and copyright law

Perhaps the point with which scientists will have less familiarity is the
licensing or waivers under which data should be made available. Broadly
speaking, a license is a text legally defining how content can be used,
modified, and distributed. Fortunately, easy to understand, non-restrictive
licenses exist, which are fit for scientific outputs. The most well known
family of them is the *Creative Commons* (CC) set.  This family of licenses
arose from a need to relax the default restrictions of normal 'All Rights
Reserved' copyright status, to expressly allow redistribution and re-use of
content on the internet within the framework of existing copyright law
[@Lessig2004]. [@Hrynaszkiewicz2012] remind us that copyright does not apply
to factual data, and so licenses should not be applied to this data. Where
possible it is best to apply the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Waiver to
scientific data in most cases, to ensure that re-use is as frictionless and
legally-unencumbered as possible. The CC0 waiver does not legally force
citation of data when it is re-used. Nor should it. No one to our knowledge
has ever sued another party for lack of academic acknowledgment of data re-
use.

These matters are not policed by legal courts, but rather the social and
community norms of academics and thus have no need for legal protection by
copyright law. Legally enforcing even just attribution via a licensing
mechanism can and does cause *real problems* that are best avoided e.g.
'attribution stacking' [@Mietchen2012], thus CC0 is recommended for most data
to avoid unnecessary complications. This particular waiver is used by
*Dryad* (a data repository associated with, *e.g.*, *The American Naturalist*)
and *fig**share*** (though only for datasets).  Where the 'data' are more
artistically-expressed (a prime example is color plates of organism pictures)
they are covered under copyright law, and can if desired, be licensed. An acceptable license that minimally
impedes science progress is the Creative Commons Attribution (*CC BY*)
license, which allows use and reproduction of the data as long as the original
data is cited in the manner specified by the author(s) and not in any way that
suggests that they endorse the re-use (this license is used for all non-
data submissions in *fig**share***). Concerns over the use of CC BY in
academia have been exhaustively answered by Creative Commons recently as so
many academics in the UK were confused (`http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data`). The *Creative
Commons* website offers an intuitive free tool to choose a license
(`http://creativecommons.org/choose/`). We urge readers to take heed of the
above, and strongly encourage scientists to be aware of the pitfalls
associated with the other more restrictive license modules available when
selecting one [@Hagedorn2011 ; @Klimpel2012].

# How it should be encouraged

## The role of journals

Journals are in the best position to make things move [@Vision2010] because a
scientist's career depend on getting his work published. Although a bottom-up
approach should always be preferred when possible, editors have in their hand
a powerful lever to modify our collective behavior. Some journals are now
asking the authors to deposit their ecological data in a public repository
[@Fairbairn2011 ; @Whitlock2010]. This is mandatory for sequences in all
journals (*GenBank*), and similar mandatory archiving of all data in TreeBase,
DataDryad, or FigShare is becoming a common practice. The referees are,
however, rarely asked to evaluate if the adequate data are released, and even
more rarely given access to the data during the evaluation process. About this
last point, an increased collaboration between journals and data sharing
platforms, to allow referees to anonymously access the data, should be
encouraged. In practice, authors are still free to release summary statistics
instead of raw data, which allows to reproduce the paper, but not to confirm
the validity of the approach. There are however signals that things are
changing. The *Nature* journals family will implement a more robust data
sharing policy, effective in May 2013, to reduce the irreproducibility of life
science papers [@NPG2013].

Journal-led mandates cannot be the only solution used. When compliance with
journal stipulations are retrospectively checked, even clinical trials data
compliance [@Prayle2012] and *GenBank* archiving of data are not universally
adhered to, even in the 'best' journals of highest reputation [@Noor2006].
Journals must take care that data archiving mandates are enforced and not just
'rhetoric', be it through increased editorial control, or by asking the
referees to evaluate the data sharing plans. In addition, journals should
implement incentives for authors to cite the datasets, and not just the paper
to which they are attached. Strong limitations on the number of references can
currently impede this practice, as it will force authors to choose citations.
In the context of meta-analyses, this can become especially problematic. The
solution of having references part of the supplementary materials is not
optimal either, as it comes with no assurance that they will be registered as
a citation to the dataset, and will benefit from less exposure. To this
effect, having an additional reference, as it will valorize the production of
data as literature items.

## The role of funding agencies

In our opinion, the first step that funding agencies can take to encourage
good data sharing practices is to recognize the value of data contributions.
We outlined some initiatives in this sense earlier in the text. In this
perspective, the fact that datasets can be attributed a DOI, which allows one
to cite them, is an important step forward. This allows to measure the long-
term impact of a dataset, by following how citations accumulate. Especially
for early-career scientists, it is frequent that the computer code of the
datasets are available long before the paper is even in press. When applying
to grants or positions, whether the funding agency recognizes "non-
publication" research products can make all the difference.

On the other hand, there is a need for a collective discussion between
scientists and funding agencies. In addition to recognizing the value of data,
should agencies *request* their availability as a condition to
obtain a grant? Round-tables between ecologists and representative
of funding agencies during large ecological meetings (*ESA*,
*INTECOL*, *EEF*, *BES* for example) can be a productive step
forward, and can help drafting recommendations which will improve
our data sharing practices. However, it is important that not much
coerciveness goes in these measures, as it can render some
needlessly hostile to the logic of data sharing, which in our
opinion would only hinder scientific advancement. Although we
clearly would appreciate enforcement of data sharing policies by
funders, we think that this should be accompanied by a didactic
effort to make the point that there are few downsides to data
sharing.

# Conclusion

In the last two years, there were an important number of media outbursts, and
public indignation, about the role of science and scientific conduct. They 
may all have been avoided if the practice of putting data publicly online was
widespread. The so-called *climategate* [@Jasanoff2010] could have been
largely averted if all data were made public in the earlier days of the
affair, as it was later clearly demonstrated that the apparent lack of
transparency eroded public trust in scientists [@Leiserowitz2010 ;
@Ravetz2011]. Even more recently, the controversy over a study on the
carcinogenicity of GM maize [@Seralini2012] was thickened by the refusal of
both sides (Monsanto and the French research group) to release the full data,
in addition to many undisclosed conflicts of interests [@Meldolesi2012].

When journal editors publicly discussed the matter, they called this
*data archiving* [@Fairbairn2011 ; @Whitlock2010]. We would exhort other
scientists not to use this expression too much. Data *archiving* evokes
cardboard boxes, in which data are put to collect some dust. Whether this
happens in the hard-drive of a scientist or in a well-maintained repository
only differs in the fact that the later solution comes with a DOI. We think
that the process or making data available should be called in a way which
reflects its objective: *data sharing*. We have the technology in place to give
data a second life, in which the scientific community can appropriate them,
recognize the paternity of those who generated them, and acknowledge this
through citations. Data are all we care about. They make science, and
especially in such data-hungry fields as ecology, possible. Sharing them
ensure that people needing data to feed models, test routines, or perform
meta-analyses can do that, and people contributing these data are
recognized for their effort. Data bring answers to our questions, and much
better, questions to our answers. After serving us so well, they deserve
better than to be *archived*.
