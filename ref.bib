	licenses defining terms for the distribution and re-use of creative
	works. CC provides licenses for different use cases and includes
	open content licenses such as the Attribution license (CC BY, used
	by many Open Access scientific publishers) and the Attribution Share

	Although many people identify \&ldquo;non-commercial\&rdquo; with
	\&ldquo;non-profit\&rdquo;, detailed analysis reveals that significant
	differences exist and that the license may impose some unexpected
	re-use limitations on works thus licensed. After providing background
	information on the concepts of Creative Commons licenses in general,
	this contribution focuses on the NC condition, its advantages, disadvantages
	and appropriate scope. Specifically, it contributes material towards
	a risk analysis for potential re-users of NC-licensed works. </p>}},

  abstract = {{Copyright and licensing of scientific data, internationally, are
	complex and present legal barriers to data sharing, integration and
	reuse, and therefore restrict the most efficient transfer and discovery
	of scientific knowledge. Much data are included within scientific
	journal articles, their published tables, additional files (supplementary
	material) and reference lists. However, these data are usually published
	under licenses which are not appropriate for data. Creative Commons
	CC0 is an appropriate and increasingly accepted method for dedicating
	data to the public domain, to enable data reuse with the minimum
	of restrictions. BioMed Central is committed to working towards implementation
	of open data-compliant licensing in its publications. Here we detail
	a protocol for implementing a combined Creative Commons Attribution
	license (for copyrightable material) and Creative Commons CC0 waiver
	(for data) agreement for content published in peer-reviewed open
	access journals. We explain the differences between legal requirements
	for attribution in copyright, and cultural requirements in scholarship
	for giving individuals credit for their work through citation. We
	argue that publishing data in scientific journals under CC0 will
	have numerous benefits for individuals and society, and yet will
	have minimal implications for authors and minimal impact on current
	publishing and research workflows. We provide practical examples
	and definitions of data types, such as XML and tabular data, and
	specific secondary use cases for published data, including text mining,
	reproducible research, and open bibliography. We believe this proposed
	change to the current copyright and licensing structure in science
	publishing will help clarify what users -- people and machines --
	of the published literature can do, legally, with journal articles
	and make research using the published literature more efficient.
	We further believe this model could be adopted across multiple publishers,
	and invite comment on this article from all stakeholders in scientific
	research.}},

	sharing and integration of large amounts of data, but many researchers
	resist sharing their primary biodiversity data. We recently conducted
	an international survey to ascertain the attitudes, experiences,
	and expectations regarding biodiversity data sharing and archiving
	of researchers. The results show that whereas most respondents are
	willing to share article-related biodiversity data, more than 60\%
	of respondents are unwilling to share primary data before publishing.
	Results indicate an underdeveloped culture of data sharing and several
	major technological and operational barriers. A major concern for
	researchers is appropriate benefits from data sharing. Most respondents
	would accept data archiving policies of journals. Researchers also
	express concerns about how to easily and efficiently deal with data
	and data quality in public databases. Expectations for biodiversity
	databases include standardization of data format, user-friendly data
	submission tools, formats for different types of data, and coordination
	among databases. The survey results provide suggestions for improving
	data sharing and archiving by individual scientists, organizations,

	Registry based study of clinical trial summaries. Data sources ClinicalTrials.gov,
	searched on 19 January 2011, with cross referencing with Drugs@FDA
	to determine for which trials mandatory reporting was required within
	one year.Selection criteria Studies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov
	with US sites which completed between 1 January and 31 December 2009.Main
	outcome measure Proportion of trials for which results had been reported.Results
	The ClinicalTrials.gov registry contained 83 579 entries for interventional
	trials, of which 5642 were completed within the timescale of interest.
	We identified trials as falling within the mandatory reporting rules
	if they were covered by the FDAAA (trials of a drug, device, or biological
	agent, which have at least one US site, and are of phase II or later)
	and if they investigated a drug that already had approval from the
	Food and Drug Administration. Of these, 163/738 (22\%) had reported
	results within one year of completion of the trial compared with
	76/727 (10\%) trials that were not subject to mandatory reporting
	(95\% confidence interval for the difference in proportions 7.8\%
	to 15.5\%; χ2 test, P=2.6×10−9). Later phase trials were more likely
	to report results (P=4.4×10−11), as were industry funded trials (P=2.2×10−16).Conclusion
	Most trials subject to mandatory reporting did not report results
	within a year of completion.}},
